## What is this application
-It is a covid 19 tracker taken from information provided by: "https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"
-The data I wanted to keep track of is the list of countries, total cases, new cases, total deaths, new deaths, total reovered, active cases, total tests, and total population
