# Final Project README
## What is this application?
It is a covid 19 tracker taken from information provided by: "https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"

The data I wanted to keep track of is the list of countries, total cases, new cases, total deaths, new deaths, total reovered, active cases, total tests, and total population

## Below is what the application looks like

## How do you use the application?

Step one you run the python file called: coronavirustracker.py

Step two, once the application appears you may choose multiple ways to do this:

--Number One: is you dont have to input anything in the blank box and select no file type and hit submit. Once you do this only a notification will appear and it will be the results of all the countries combined. So, it defaults as 'world' if nothing is inputted. The result of this is below:

I tried to get the right numbers for this but could not figure it out.

--Number Two: is you can input a country in the fill the blank such as 'Norway' and not select a file type but hit submit button and you will get a notification of the covid numbers just in that country. The result of this is below:

--Number Three: the last option you can do is input a country in the fill the blank scuh as 'Norway', then select a file type such as 'html', then click submit. Once you do this a screen will prompt up asking you to choose a location to save this file of data

Once you choose a location and hit save a screen will pop of the file path you choosen, this can be seen below:

Now you can open up the data on Norway by goign to your html file!

Step three, to exit the application entirely just click the red 'x' button in the top right of application and it will end the program.
